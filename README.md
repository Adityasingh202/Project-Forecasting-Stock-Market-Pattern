Among investors, the ability to predict future developments or crises in the stock market has long been highly valued. During the COVID-19 worldwide pandemic, this skill became even more crucial, underscoring the need of risk management in preserving stability in such unpredictable times. 

Although there is a rising need for reliable intelligent systems that can precisely anticipate stock prices to inform investment strategies, traditional business research still uses a variety of risk management techniques. Nowadays, a large portion of this field's research focuses on applying machine learning techniques to predict stock price patterns. While these approaches have shown encouraging results, there aren't many thorough surveys that list all of the machine learning algorithms used for stock price prediction.
